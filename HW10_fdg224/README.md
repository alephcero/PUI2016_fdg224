#Assignment 2

As Figure 3 shows, ridership by month during the summer months, it seems to be a stationary process, with a slight ridership's increase towards the end (summer 2015). Regarding seasonal decomposition for the summer months for 12 months period (we see data for July months), the tendency is there, with an increase towards the end. As we look into summmer months, there is no seasonality within them (Figure 4).

Secondly, Figure 5 shows the median and interquartile range for ridership in the winter months from 2014 to 2016. When it comes to winter, the tendency to increase towards the end is also there, although there is some drop during the 2015's winter. The seasonal decomposition for winter months (Figure 6) shows that estructure with a decrease in 2015 and back to the increase in 2016. This effect could be due to extraordinary temperatures (unusualy cold during 2015 and unusualy hot during 2016) and/or an increase in stations in time (also a long term tendency of biking in NYC).

The maps in Figure 7 show monthly rides aggregated by census track for the summer and winter months. The pattern appears to be the same, with excepcions of a track on south close to the Hudson and those close to the Central Park. This make sense as is to be expected that during summmer people will focus more on recreational use of citibike in areas close to the Hudson river and the Central Park, with the sport related infraestrcuture that this zones have.


Also, the maps in Figure 8 show the distribution of ridership by census tracks using quantiles to group ridership. Some difference appears between summer and winter, as the summer months show the area along the Hudson in the higher quantiles, while the winter months this area is between the lower quantiles and at the same time the area around the Central Park crosses from the lowes quantiles to the middle ones.

As for the spatial lag of ridership by monthly rides for the summer and winter months, the relationship appears to be the same, except for the overall lower ridership during the winter months (Figure 9).

Finally, the maps in Figure 11  show the hot and cold spots for the winter and summer months, based on ridership by census track. The pattern appears to be the same, with the exception of the Upper East Side that during winter become cold spots.
