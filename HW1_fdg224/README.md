#Homework 1

In order to provide easy access to my work enviroment within *compute*, after creating the folder, I created an enviromental variable with the PATH to it and also an alias to change directory to that PATH using that enviroment variable.

To do so, I add this lines to the *.bashrc* file within the *compute* environment

~~~~ 
export PUI2016='/home/cusp/fdg224/PUI2016_fdg224'
alias pui2016='cd $PUI2016'
~~~~
