## Cikibike Null Hypothesis project review

Your notebook should start with the motivation for doing the work you are about to do, not with data gathering. you should first state the quesion, the Null, and the analysis plan.

your Null is incorrect. If your question is "annual suscriber's trips on citi bikes last **longer** than the 24-hour pass or 7-day pass user's trips" the null has to be that the annual suscriber's trips is SHORTER OR EQUAL (ONE SIDED TEST) NOT JUST EQUAL (TWO SIDED TEST).
However, below you correctly state the question associated to the Null:
"The annual suscriber's trips average time on citi bikes is not the same that the average trip time of the 24-hour pass or 7-day pass users, for the month of June 2016."
If this difference is not clear come talk to me.

The data  supports the quesion and it is properly processed.
The figure captions should describe the plot (e.g: Figure 2 - boxplot of trip duration by subscription type, showing median, interquartile range and full distribution of trip durations. the median of the customer's trip duration is higher than the subscriber's"
