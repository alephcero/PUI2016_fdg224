## Assignment 1
File *HW5_1_fdg224.ipynb* contains the test for goodness of fit. 

## Assignment 2
File *HW5_1_fdg224.ipynb* contains the test for goodness of fit.  I received help from Ian Stuart for using kstest instead of ks_2samp.

## Assignment 3

Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

* Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control 

**H0** : Test measurements for fat loss in the diet group are the same or lower than those within the exercise

**Ha** : Test measurements for fat loss in the diet group are higher than those within the exercise.


* Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

I assume the idea is that the *majority* of the Americans trust the president. 

**H0** : The proportion of americans that answered yes is 0.50 or lower.

**Ha** : The proportion of americans that answered yes is higher than 0.50.

* Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

**H0** : Cessation rates within the nicotine patch group are the same or lower than the placebo patch group.

**Ha** : Cessation rates within the nicotine patch group are higher than the placebo patch group.

* Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

**H0** : IQ test result in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy are the same or higher than those whose mothers didn't smoke.

**Ha** : IQ test result in children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy are lower than those whose mothers didn't smoke.
