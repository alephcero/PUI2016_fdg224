#Homework 6

## Assignment 1

The objective was to come with a model that would infere Energy consumption based on the amount of residential units on a Building. For the firt variable the LL84 dataset was used, while for the second one the source was MapPLUTO data. Afeter merging, three models were under consideration (linear regression of Energy vs Units, linear regression of Units vs Energy and 2 degree polynomial of Energy vs Units) being the last one the better fit. 

I worked with Sokratis Papadopoulos (Sp4356) on the Likelihood ratio test and chi squared, who also helped me with errors in the chi squared formula and the log rules for changing the formula of the likelihood ratio test.
