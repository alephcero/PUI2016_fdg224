#Assignment 1: Finish Data Linkage Lab.

The file **HW8_1_fdg224** contains the lab for data linkage. I worked with Sokratis (sp4356) in the detection of unusual community Boards. I used % of household with a college degree or above and the % os households with broadband connnection. Then I used those variables to fit a polynomial model. 

#Assignment 2: Peer review of 2 classmateâ€™s plots

I reviewed the plot of Zhaohong Niu (zn352, GitHUb: EstherNiu) and Aaron Jude D'Souza (ajd629, GitHUb: aaron-15).

Both plots and review are in this folder with the student id in the name of the file.
