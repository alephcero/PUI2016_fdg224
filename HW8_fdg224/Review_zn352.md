#Barplot of average trip duration by group age REVIEW  

What I like about the plot is that is clean, with good axis labels and explaining title. Also, you added a caption with a clear description of your plot and a short analysis of the trend and the unusual values, with a possible explanation for those. Nonetheless, maybe the bars are to high and the trip duration could have been expressed in minutes instead of seconds (also showing the units of measure in the Y axis label). Also, as you clearly pointed out, there is an unusual pattern when within high age groups. A visualization of another contextual variable, like trip's distance could be plotted using a line and a second Y axis.
